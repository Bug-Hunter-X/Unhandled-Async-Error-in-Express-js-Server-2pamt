# Unhandled Asynchronous Error in Node.js Express.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications:  unhandled asynchronous errors within request handlers. The server silently fails without providing any feedback to the client.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server with an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`). If this operation throws an error, the error is logged to the console but no response is sent to the client, resulting in a hanging request.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle asynchronous errors using `try...catch` blocks and sending appropriate error responses to the client.
